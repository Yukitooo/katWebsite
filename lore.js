const loreText1 = `Katarina Du Couteau was not born into comfort — she was born into expectation. As the eldest daughter of the infamous General Marcus Du Couteau, one of Noxus’s most revered and strategic warlords, Katarina’s future was forged in iron before she could even lift a blade. Her birthright was not merely status, but responsibility — to lead, to conquer, and to uphold the unyielding strength that defined her family name. In Noxus, power is earned through blood and discipline, and Katarina was expected to embody that truth from the very beginning.

From childhood, she was immersed in a world of military precision and unrelenting ambition. While other children read fables, Katarina was studying maps, battle formations, and the anatomy of a perfect kill. Her earliest toys were daggers; her first lessons were in silence, focus, and survival. Her tutors were not gentle mentors, but hardened soldiers who answered directly to her father — a man who believed weakness was a luxury his children could not afford. Under his cold, tactical gaze, Katarina's mistakes were not just corrected — they were carved into memory as lessons, each one sharpening her resolve.

There was no room for softness in the Du Couteau household. Praise was scarce; progress was measured in speed, precision, and efficiency. Even within her own home, Katarina was constantly tested — against herself, against her tutors, and eventually, against her younger sister, Cassiopeia. Though their paths would later diverge, the seeds of rivalry were planted early. For Katarina, every step forward was a defiance of expectation and a declaration of her will to stand not in her father’s shadow — but beside him, as his equal.

By the time she reached adolescence, Katarina was already a phantom in the training grounds — fast, silent, and utterly focused. Her blades moved like they were part of her body, guided not by hesitation but by instinct. Yet even then, she craved more than her father’s approval. She wanted recognition, not as a daughter fulfilling duty, but as a warrior carving her own path through the unforgiving heart of Noxus. The blood in her veins demanded excellence — and she would meet that demand, no matter the cost.`;

 
const loreText2 = `Katarina’s rise within Noxus was never meant to be ordinary. Though she was trained to follow orders, her ambition would not be shackled by protocol or patience. Her skills had surpassed those of her instructors, and her reputation as a rising blade spread quickly through the barracks and beyond. But to Katarina, that wasn't enough. She wanted more than whispered respect — she wanted to etch her name into the history of Noxus. And she would do it in her own way.

Her defining moment came during a critical mission orchestrated by her father. Katarina had been ordered to eliminate a lesser political figure — an assignment designed to test her obedience, not her skill. But her eyes were set on a more dangerous target: a high-ranking Demacian general, heavily protected and far more significant to the Noxian war effort. The kill would be difficult — reckless, even — but if successful, it would be legendary.

Without permission, Katarina changed the plan. Under the cover of darkness, she infiltrated the enemy’s inner sanctum, bypassing elite guards and magical wards with a blend of speed, cunning, and sheer nerve. The strike itself was flawless — her blades found their mark, and her escape was swift. It should have been a moment of glory.

Instead, it was met with fury.

Her actions, while tactically brilliant, had jeopardized broader military strategy. The premature assassination of the general disrupted a larger plan and escalated tensions on the front. Worse still, her defiance was a direct insult to her father’s authority. General Du Couteau’s wrath was swift and cold. He saw not a daughter fulfilling her potential, but a soldier who had endangered Noxus through selfish ambition.

The punishment wasn’t physical — it was exile from favor. Katarina was stripped of responsibility, sidelined in critical decisions, and made to watch from the shadows as her sister Cassiopeia took on roles she had long fought to earn. The sting of dishonor ran deeper than any wound. It was the first time Katarina truly tasted failure — and it nearly broke her.

But in that failure, something new was forged.

No longer driven by the need to impress her father, Katarina turned inward. She trained harder, thought deeper, and embraced solitude as her crucible. Every mistake became a lesson. Every scar, a reminder of discipline. She began to understand the difference between arrogance and mastery — and she vowed never to confuse them again. She would become more than a name, more than a daughter. She would become a precision weapon, one no leader could afford to ignore — not even General Du Couteau himself.

Thus began the true assassin’s path — not born from loyalty, but reborn through consequence.`;

const loreText3 = `Failure had wounded Katarina’s pride, but it did not destroy her. If anything, it sharpened her. Stripped of favor and forced to live with the consequences of her reckless ambition, she turned inward and began to rebuild herself—not as her father's obedient soldier, but as her own harshest critic and most disciplined mentor. In isolation, she refined her technique to something near perfection. She studied her missteps, internalized the lessons of silence and restraint, and honed her instincts to act not on impulse, but with deadly calculation.

Her blades, once wild with hunger for glory, now moved with calm, focused intent. No motion was wasted. No emotion leaked through. Katarina’s reputation began to quietly resurface—among soldiers, whispers of flawless kills returned. Commanders spoke her name again, this time with a note of caution, even fear. She had become something more than dangerous. She had become precise.

Yet, her return to form did not come without tension. In the wake of Katarina's fall from grace, her younger sister Cassiopeia had risen in political influence. Where Katarina had chosen the sword, Cassiopeia had chosen manipulation, diplomacy, and subterfuge. She learned how to wield information like a weapon, and her voice became one of growing power among Noxus's ruling elite. The sisters, once inseparable in their youth, now stood on opposite ends of the empire’s spectrum: one a silent killer in the shadows, the other a serpent among nobles.

Their rivalry was not merely personal — it was ideological. Cassiopeia believed that Noxus's future lay in controlled dominance, the kind that could sway kings and break alliances without drawing a blade. Katarina believed that power should be enforced, swiftly and visibly, with steel and blood as proof. They clashed in meetings, in strategy halls, and eventually in whispered accusations. But what cut deepest was the knowledge that each sister viewed the other as a threat—not to the empire, but to their father's legacy and their place in it.

Still, Katarina pressed forward. She did not ask for forgiveness, nor did she wait for permission. She let her blades speak for her. Each successful mission was a word in a sentence of redemption. She eliminated targets too dangerous to be handled by the military. She infiltrated enemy lines and returned without a sound. And she did it all without recognition, because recognition was no longer her goal.

What Katarina sought was something purer than approval: she wanted control. Control over her destiny, over her skill, and over the narrative that had once defined her as reckless and impulsive. Through grit, discipline, and unwavering focus, she earned her way back into the empire’s favor—not through titles or politics, but through fear. Noxus came to know that if Katarina Du Couteau had been sent to finish you, there would be no escape, no mercy, and no mistake.

In the silent war for her legacy, Katarina had found redemption—not from others, but from herself.`;

const loreText4 = `As Katarina continued to rise as one of Noxus’s most efficient and feared assassins, her path began to intersect with forces more elusive—and more dangerous—than any enemy general or rival sister. Beneath the disciplined military structure of the Noxian empire, another layer of power operated in shadows: the Black Rose, an ancient and secretive cabal known to influence the empire’s direction from behind velvet curtains and blood-stained scrolls. Their influence stretched across generations, and their eyes had been watching Katarina for some time.

To the public, the Black Rose was little more than a myth. But Katarina, through whispered intel and veiled threats disguised as offers, came to understand just how real—and how powerful—they were. They did not rule with armies. They ruled with secrets, manipulation, and surgical precision. In Katarina, they saw the perfect weapon: loyal to Noxus, skilled beyond compare, and already accustomed to working in silence. All she needed was the right push.

That push came when her father, General Marcus Du Couteau, mysteriously disappeared.

One day, he was commanding elite forces with iron resolve. The next, he was gone—without warning, without a trace. No blood. No battlefield. Only silence. The disappearance shook Katarina to her core. Though their relationship had been strained, her father was a symbol of order and clarity in her chaotic world. And now that foundation had vanished.

While the empire scrambled to explain the loss, Katarina followed leads too dangerous for even Noxian intelligence to chase. Her search led her into the orbit of the Black Rose—an organization that had not only predicted the general’s fall, but perhaps orchestrated it. Yet instead of resistance, Katarina found herself drawn deeper. She accepted missions whose origins were deliberately vague, orders delivered in whispers rather than written form. Her targets became increasingly political, their deaths sending ripples through noble houses and council chambers.

Katarina began to understand that she was no longer just a soldier or a tool of vengeance. She had become a catalyst—used by forces she barely trusted, yet strangely aligned with. The Black Rose offered her knowledge, cryptic truths, and paths of influence that no military command could ever grant. They fed her suspicions about her sister’s ambitions, about Noxus’s internal fractures, and about the true cost of loyalty.

But Katarina was no pawn.

Though she accepted their missions, she never surrendered her judgment. She navigated this web of conspiracies with the same discipline she brought to every kill—calm, sharp, and precise. She knew that in the end, the Black Rose had its own agenda, and she would not be used blindly. Katarina played their game, but she kept her own daggers sharpened—ready for when the time would come to turn them on friend, foe, or phantom alike.

In the twilight between loyalty and manipulation, Katarina became something more than a soldier—she became a weapon shaped by the empire’s light and shadow alike.`;


const loreText5 = `Katarina is no longer the impulsive young warrior desperate to prove herself, nor the disgraced daughter clawing her way back to honor. Through every mission, every betrayal, and every calculated strike, she has forged herself into something sharper than steel and colder than fear—a force of intent. She is now the Sinister Blade not because of her title, but because of the clarity with which she moves through the chaos of Noxus and beyond.

Gone are the days when Katarina sought validation from her father or envied her sister’s influence. General Du Couteau’s absence has left a void in the empire’s leadership, but for Katarina, it has brought focus. She no longer serves for approval; she serves because she chooses to. Her path is self-defined—one guided not by blind loyalty to Noxus, but by her vision of what Noxus should be: ruthless, yes, but not corrupted by deceit or consumed by ambition.

Her actions now echo with purpose. Each assassination is a strategic act, not just to eliminate a threat, but to shape the outcome of conflicts before they ever reach the battlefield. Katarina operates on the razor's edge between military precision and personal morality. She does not kill out of hatred or hunger for glory—she kills because she believes in calculated strength. To her, hesitation is weakness, and weakness has no place in the empire she’s helping to mold.

Though she works in the shadows, her presence is felt throughout Runeterra. Commanders speak of her in hushed tones; enemies build strategies just to avoid drawing her attention. She has become a silent enforcer of Noxian ideals—a ghost in the dark whose blade brings not just death, but a message: Noxus sees everything, and Katarina delivers its final word.

But even in her control, Katarina remains wary. She knows power breeds new threats. She watches her sister Cassiopeia with sharpened suspicion, and keeps one eye on the Black Rose, whose favors always come with unseen strings. In this ever-shifting world of politics and war, Katarina’s greatest weapon is not her daggers—it is her clarity of purpose.

She has become more than an assassin. She is a symbol of decisive strength. An agent of balance in an empire built on power. And whether her name is whispered in fear or in awe, one truth remains:

If Katarina Du Couteau is coming for you, it’s already too late.`;
